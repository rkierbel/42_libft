# 42_libft
Libc and custom functions - to be used throughout the 42 common core

First project of the 42 cursus' common core

The main challenge is to perfectly replicate the behaviour of the libc functions while understanding that they need to be adequately protected by :
- preventing memory leaks of all kind;
- ensuring sound error management.

Peer-to-peer evaluation, on which is based the cursus at 42, has proven to be already extremely helpful and insightful.

Failure is (the main) part of the learning process.
