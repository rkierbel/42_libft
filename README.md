# 42_libft
Libc and custom functions - to be used throughout the 42 common core

First project of the 42 cursus' common core

The main challenge is to perfectly replicate the behaviour of the libc functions while understanding that they need to be adequately protected by :
- preventing memory leaks of all kind;
- ensuring sound error management.

What I took from this project :
- rigor++++
- patience++
- algorithmics++

Peer-to-peer evaluation, on which is based the cursus at 42, has proven to be already much more helpful than traditional Belgian university solo learning style (you need to be evaluated by three students to validate one project. You start your cursus with 5 evaluation points. You spend a point to be evaluated once, you win one point when you conduct an evaluation yourself).

Failure is (the main) part of the learning process.
